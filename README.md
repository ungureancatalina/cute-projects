## About the Project

**Cute Projects** is a collection of small, creative, and fun JavaScript-based web applications. These mini-projects are designed for learning, experimentation, and entertainment. Each one focuses on different aspects of web development such as DOM manipulation, animations, game logic, or interactive UI elements.

The goal of this collection is to build joyful and accessible experiences while exploring frontend development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
